"""
Command pattern decouples the object invoking a job from the one who knows
how to do it. As mentioned in the GoF book, a good example is in menu items.
You have a menu that has lots of items. Each item is responsible for doing a
special thing and you want your menu item just call the execute method when
it is pressed. To achieve this you implement a command object with the execute
method for each menu item and pass to it.

*About the example
We have a menu containing two items. Each item accepts a file name, one hides the file
and the other deletes it. Both items have an undo option.
Each item is a MenuItem class that accepts the corresponding command as input and executes
it's execute method when it is pressed.

*TL;DR
Object oriented implementation of callback functions.

*Examples in Python ecosystem:
Django HttpRequest (without execute method):
