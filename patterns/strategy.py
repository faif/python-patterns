"""
In most of other languages Strategy pattern is implemented via creating some
base strategy interface/abstract class and subclassing it with a number of
concrete strategies (as we can see at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern), however Python supports
higher-order functions and allows us to have only one class and inject
functions into it's instances, as shown in this example.

# Strategy Example 0
