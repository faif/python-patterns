"""
*What is this pattern about?
The Adapter pattern provides a different interface for a class. We can
think about it as a cable adapter that allows you to charge a phone
somewhere that has outlets in a different shape. Following this idea,
the Adapter pattern is useful to integrate classes that couldn't be
integrated due to their incompatible interfaces.

*What does this example do?

The example has classes that represent entities (Dog, Cat, Human, Car)
that make different noises. The Adapter class provides a different
interface to the original methods that make such noises. So the
original interfaces (e.g., bark and meow) are available under a
different name: make_noise.

*Where is the pattern used practically?
The Grok framework uses adapters to make objects work with a
particular API without modifying the objects themselves:
http://grok.zope.org/doc/current/grok_overview.html#adapters

*TL;DR
Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
